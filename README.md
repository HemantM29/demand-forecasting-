Demand Types Classification:
This project focuses on understanding and categorizing different demand patterns within sales data. By utilizing historical sales data from sources like the Olist E-Commerce dataset, the project aims to classify entities such as SKUs or products based on their demand patterns (e.g., smooth, intermittent, erratic, lumpy). This categorization is crucial for building appropriate demand models tailored to each pattern, enabling better inventory planning, price management, workforce optimization, and financial planning. The pipeline developed in this project involves data loading, pre-filtering, pattern detection, feature engineering, and model fitting steps.

Demand Unconstraining Using Expectation-Maximization (EM):
This project addresses the challenge of dealing with constrained demand data, where sales metrics are limited by factors such as stock levels or capacity constraints. The goal is to handle out-of-stock events and unrealized demand accurately. By applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the project aims to "unconstrain" the demand data, effectively imputing values for constrained periods. This process ensures that the analysis and forecasting are based on complete and accurate data, improving the reliability of inventory planning, demand forecasting, and other optimization strategies.

Both projects offer practical solutions for businesses dealing with sales data, providing insights and tools to better understand demand dynamics, optimize operations, and make informed decisions to drive business success.
